"""Deployed thresholds — the ONE place any rail/threshold is written (DRY;
fleet doctrine: "thresholds must not drift"). Each constant cites its
section of .hermes/plans/2026-09-25-jev-parity-api-spec-v2.md so a change is
always a deliberate, auditable re-read of the contract.

These are Laya's OWN re-implementations of published policy numbers (D1:
native rewrite; the numbers are the spec, not their code).

# NO-SIGNAL rail (2026-09-30, ft_rrk3 live audit): the deployed rerank
# head CANNOT separate classes — over the full 302-row gold corpus (1208
# rel questions) the yes-vs-no margin is p50 -0.002 / max 0.107 and rel
# scores never left [0.027, 0.517] whichever label was gold. Its rel
# magnitude therefore carries no information: an empty shortlist where
# not ONE rel reached the rel rail and no inj reached the inj rail is the
# head's SILENCE, not a verdict of "all irrelevant". Answering that with
# chosen:[] silently discards the caller's context behind an honest-
# looking screening:"laya+local" label — the dangerous failure. The row's
# fail-open column answers instead (baseline order + local-only
# screening, no model claims). When ANY score crosses a rail the head
# did speak and the normal rails decide (a flagged injection still
# drops its passage). Retires when a retrained rerank head lands
