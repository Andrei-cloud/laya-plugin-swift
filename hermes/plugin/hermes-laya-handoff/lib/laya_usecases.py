"""The twelve use-case primitives (spec-v2 §2 CLI ops table, §3 routing
policy, §4 privacy, §5 floors — THE contract this module implements).

Pure policy + question-building on top of ``Engine.question``: no HTTP, no
daemon imports, nothing here can hang (engine calls are the caller's
problem — an engine raise becomes this module's fail-open answer). Every
primitive is a function ``name(engine, ...)`` returning a plain dict that:

  (a) builds its questions in the frozen wire shapes (spec §1/§2:
      ``noul|choice|score``, the per-op question names),
  (b) applies the CODE rails exactly as §2/§3 state them — rails are code,
      answers are model (spec §3 "deterministic rails + model answers"),
  (c) returns the spec's usable degraded answer when the engine raises
      ``RuntimeError``/``ValueError`` (``status:"fail_open"`` + the §2
      fail-open column shape), never raising to its caller,
  (d) logs via ``laya_decisions.log_decision`` where the spec names a log
      kind: "route" for route_turn, "skill" for skill_select. Triage/mail/
      supervise/choose have no named log kind in §4's vocabulary, so they
      do not log (log_decision would refuse the kind anyway).

Every threshold/rail number is imported from ``laya_constants`` (DRY;
"thresholds must not drift"); the four numbers the constants module does
not (yet) carry — PLAN_KINDS, PLAN_STEPS_MAX, the agent-targeted pattern
list, the base64 block regex — are defined here with their spec § cited
(file-ownership constraint of this change; a later move into
laya_constants is a mechanical, auditable edit). Every env read goes
through ``naming.env_alias`` (decision D6).

Privacy before send (spec §4): any user text entering engine state passes
``laya_decisions.redact`` and the ``ASK_CHARS + ASK_CHARS_HEADROOM`` cap
FIRST; passages ride as ``P0..Pn`` placeholders (real ids never sent).
EXCEPTION (deviation): the choose row's candidate ``label`` fields go into
the question criteria verbatim — labels are builder-supplied (the
orchestrator that built the candidate table), not message content; the
goal and regions (the user-content fields of that row) ARE redacted. A
builder that lets user content into labels must redact at its side.
Credential-shaped content in message/turn/passage text is NEVER sent
anywhere unredacted (spec §2 triage row, §4).

"Jev" appears in comments and in accepted legacy aliases only (D7/D8:
module names and public symbols are laya_*).
